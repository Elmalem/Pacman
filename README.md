##  Project 4 is actually a continuation project for Project 3  

Actually upgrading it by adding players and shapes to upgrade the
 player experience to the maximum possible within the current project

The quality of Project 4 differentiates it from Project 3 by several very important parameters.

## The Manual Shake - 
In Project 4 there is a possibility for the player to play manually in a separate player whose step can accurately simulate the original game by eating "pecans" 
and eating fruits to accumulate the maximum points.
## Key additions:

### The player -
an object that moves manually or by operation and gives the result faster than in the manual game, if you wish

### Maps -
There are 9 game modes built into the project and you can also refer to them as "steps" from 1 to 9.
### Manual map -
You can build the "map" for the game by "pakmans" "Ghost" "fruit" and "boxes".

### Smart algorithm -
The smart algorithm is actually an upgrade of the algorithm from Project 3 and there are computational functions that answer all the problems created during the game,
There is an in-depth breakdown of how to think about examples and details about the problem and how to solve it.
