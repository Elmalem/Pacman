in this Exercise we Add an Addition game that you can access Through class. in this game you have one pacman in the color magenta that is your player. 

beside him you have a number of "enemy" pacman on the board and a number of ghosts and offcourse fruits.

you also have barrier on your way which stop you from moving. your objective is to gain the highst score.

you can gain points by either eat fruits, eat the enemy pacman and finishing the game early.

you can loss points if you get touch by a ghost ,enter inside a barrier or leave the game map bounderies.

in the beginning of the game you can select which game you want to play in our "load" option in our menu in the upper left side of the screen. 

you have 9 option of game to choose from with diffrent number of pacmans, ghosts and barriers.

in the beggining you can also choose where to put your player, the player have a default location but you can choose to move it if you want. 

you move it by clicking with your mouse on where you want to put it. now you have two option you can play it on manual mode or Automate.

in Manual mode you can control your player using the mouse button. you can push on the map to which direction you want it to go. 

in The Autmate game your player move on it own using The algorithm to choose the path to the fruits.

## The Manual Shake - 
In Project 4 there is a possibility for the player to play manually in a separate player whose step can accurately simulate the original game by eating "pecans" 
and eating fruits to accumulate the maximum points.
## Key additions:

### The player -
![The player](https://github.com/bargenish44/Ex4-OOP/blob/master/player.png)


an object that moves manually or by operation and gives the result faster than in the manual game, if you wish

### Maps -
There are 9 game modes built into the project and you can also refer to them as "steps" from 1 to 9.
### Manual map -
You can build the "map" for the game by "pakmans" "Ghost" "fruit" and "boxes".

### Smart algorithm -

![Smart algorithm](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Dijkstra_Animation.gif/250px-Dijkstra_Animation.gif)

The smart algorithm is actually an upgrade of the algorithm from Project 3 and there are computational functions that answer all the problems created during the game,
There is an in-depth breakdown of how to think about examples and details about the problem and how to solve it.
